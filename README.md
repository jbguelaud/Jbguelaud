### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jean-Baptiste Guelaud. After finishing an MSc in Finance at the university of Heriot-Watt, i start studying at Le Wagon in order to learn how to code with the Web Development formation. 

By doing this, I was able to discover a world that interests me enormously. During my studies I was able to do various internships as a Business Developer, but now I would like to move towards the profession of Product Manager 

If you are interested in my profile, or if you simply have questions about my career, please contact me via Linkedin. ðŸ˜Š
