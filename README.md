### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jean-Baptiste Guelaud. After finishing an MSc in Finance at the university of Heriot-Watt, i start studying at Le Wagon in order to learn how to code with the Web Development formation. 

By doing this, I was able to discover a world that interests me enormously. During my studies I was able to do various internships as a Business Developer.

If you are interested in my profile, or if you simply have questions about my experience, please contact me on Linkedin. ðŸ˜Š
